  <!-- I understand that I am supposed create a style guide, but I find it more practical and fun to develop a vision for what I want my website to look like, then simply look up how to make that happen (i.e. looking at a font family list, then selecting a font family that would look good.) I'm taking a learn-as-I-go-along approach. -->

    <h1>Atlanta Botanical Garden</h1>
    <h2>Advice For Visitors:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit as early in the day as possible, at 9AM.</li>
      <li>Get an annual pass, if you plan to visit more than once!</li>
      <li>If you're only going to go ABG once, go in autumn!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have visited the Atlanta Botanical Garden a few times. The last time I went was in October 2021, with my mother. The weather was perfect and I got to enjoy an expansive Halloween-themed section and a glass flower exhibition, which spanned the entire garden. I must have taken a hundred photos or so!</p>

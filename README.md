ABG stands for Atlanta Botanical Garden. 
Creating this website was just my way of practicing my newly acquired HTML and CSS skills 
by making a simple website about one of my favorite places!
Unfortunately, after multiple attempts, I have not been able to link my css file to my html file, so the css elements you won't be able to see:-(
